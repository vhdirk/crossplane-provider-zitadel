# Build

This project - commonly known as "the build submodule" -  is Crossplane's
Makefile library. This library is used to build `crossplane/crossplane`,
`crossplane/crossplane-runtime`, and most Crossplane providers.

The build submodule is only intended to support Crossplane and its extensions.
There's no guarantee of stability. There are no releases or versions, and any
commit may introduce a breaking change. Third parties are recommended to fork
rather than taking a dependency.

# Quickstart

To use this build project just add a submodule to your project:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/crossplane/build build
```

and add a `Makefile` in the root. For example, the following will build a go
project that publishes containers and helm charts.

```
# Project Setup
PROJECT_NAME := myrepo
PROJECT_REPO := github.com/crossplane/$(PROJECT_NAME)

PLATFORMS ?= linux_amd64 linux_arm64
include build/makelib/common.mk

S3_BUCKET ?= crossplane.releases/myrepo
include build/makelib/output.mk

# Setup Go
GO_STATIC_PACKAGES = $(GO_PROJECT)/cmd/api $(GO_PROJECT)/cmd/installer
GO_LDFLAGS += -X $(GO_PROJECT)/pkg/version.Version=$(VERSION)
include build/makelib/golang.mk

# Setup Helm
HELM_BASE_URL = https://charts.crossplane.io
HELM_S3_BUCKET = crossplane.charts
HELM_CHARTS = myrepo-api
HELM_CHART_LINT_ARGS_myrepo-api = --set nameOverride='',imagePullSecrets=''
include build/makelib/k8s_tools.mk
include build/makelib/helm.mk

# Docker images
DOCKER_myrepo = crossplane
IMAGES = myrepo
include build/makelib/image.mk
```

Now build the project by running:

```
make -j build
```

and run tests:

```
make -j tests
```

To see the help run `make help`.

## Local Development Setup

To use local development targets, first include `deploy.mk` in your make file:

```
include build/makelib/local.mk
```

Then, run the following command to initialize a local development configuration:

```
make local.scaffold
```

You can now configure and add more components (i.e. helm releases) to your local
development setup.
